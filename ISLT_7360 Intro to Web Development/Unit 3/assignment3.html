<h1>5th Grade Student Resource Page</h1>
<p>Welcome to my basic web page! I would like to put together a resource page for my 5th grade students for Science and Social Studies. This page will allow them to reference practice problems or other sources outside of class.</p>
<blockquote>"The important thing is to never stop questioning." - Albert Einstein</blockquote>
<br>
<h2>Science References</h2>
<p>These are some science topics that I would cover.</p>


<ul>
<li>Animal Cell</li>
<li>Plant Cell</li>
</ul>
<p> Here is another source that you can also use, <a href="http://www.lisd.org/technology/itswebs/elem/curr/science/5sciwebsites.htm">Science Website 5th Grade</a>. 
<h2>Social Studies References</h2>
<p>This is what I will talk about in Social Studies.</p>
<ul>

<li>Map Skills</li>
</ul>
<p>This <a href="https://www.franklinboe.org/Page/10149">Resource Website for 5th Grade Social Studies</a> is useful.</p>
