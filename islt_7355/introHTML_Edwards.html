    <p>I expect this course to brush me up on my web design and development. I have gained some experience from the Intro to Website and Development course. I hope that with my developed skills that I will be to be able to take more advanced courses where this one is a prerequisite.</p>  
    
    <p>My favorite hobby is writing. I like to do design and do handwriting in my free time. I like to learn more about how I can improve technology use in my classroom. I like to catch up on missed movies, watch talent-tv shows and police dramas. Bowling, escape houses, crossword puzzles, poetry, dramatic oral interpretation, reading, strategy games, word searches, design, research</p>
